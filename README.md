# Personal portfolio website (unfinished)

A personal website made using gatsby.

##Gatsby##

I choose gatsby as I felt it made it easier to use a fully functional react app with a CMS like Wordpress.
The data is pulled from a WordPress site using the WordPress REST API.
The gatsby wordpress plugin [gatsby-source-wordpress] and I use graphQL to query the API data
